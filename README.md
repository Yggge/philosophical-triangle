# Philosophical Triangle

A modular concept and visual model of a philosophical system based on the interaction of **Creativity**, **Mastery**, and **Consciousness** â€” forming a triangle whose internal harmony gives rise to **Synthesis**.

## Concept

The **Philosophical Triangle** is structured on three intersecting layers:

1. **Philosophy Layer**
   - Creativity (A)
   - Consciousness (C)
   - Mastery (E)

2. **Psychological Layer**
   - Creators
   - Intellectuals
   - Professionals

3. **Social Layer**
   - Declarers
   - Balancers
   - Result-driven

Each layer reflects a deep aspect of human nature, action, or society, unified through the geometric metaphor of a triangle. The model supports modular visualization, allowing translation, decorative customization, and interaction modes.

## Features

- Interactive geometric structure (matplotlib + Jupyter)
- Configurable triangle with dynamic point motion
- Extendable system for translations, UI themes, and behavioral modules
